## 📌 Overview  
AER Directives GPT is a specialized natural-language assistant designed to help engineers, regulators, project managers, and consultants quickly access Alberta Energy Regulator directives and related regulatory information.

This GPT streamlines regulatory research by enabling users to ask plain-language questions such as:

- “What directive applies to site equipment spacing?”  
- “What directives cover geothermal development?”  
- “What are the setback requirements for pipelines?”  

It retrieves relevant directive references and provides concise, context-aware summaries.
